# Texture Files for 3D Dungeon Game

This directory should contain the following texture files:
- floor.jpg - Floor texture (ideally tileable)
- wall.jpg - Wall texture (ideally tileable)
- player.jpg - Player texture map
- enemy.jpg - Enemy texture map

For best results, use square texture images (e.g., 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024) in JPG or PNG format.

You can find free textures at:
- https://opengameart.org/
- https://www.textures.com/ (limited free textures)
- https://freestocktextures.com/
- https://www.pexels.com/search/texture/

Notes:
- Make sure images are properly licensed for your use
- For web performance, keep image sizes reasonable (under 1MB each)
- The game will use placeholder data if these images are missing, but will look much better with proper textures
